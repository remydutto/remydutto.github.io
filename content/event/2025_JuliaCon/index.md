summary: Optimal synthesis of membrane filtration systems

abstract: 'The performance of membrane filtration system could be improved by optimal control. We present a code in Julia for the optimal control of membrane filtration systems, for a wide range of models proposed in the literature, mainly based on combination of automatic differentiation (ForwardDiff.jl) and numerical integration of ordinary differential equations (OrdinaryDiffEq.jl). \

\

Membrane filtration systems are widely used in various industries, including water treatment, food processing, and pharmaceuticals. The performance of these systems is influenced by several factors, including membrane fouling, backwash cycle, and flow dynamics. Optimal control of these systems is crucial for maximizing efficiency and minimizing operational costs. Some recent works [1, 2] propose a model-based optimal control strategy. Our purpose is to develop a generic code to provide the optimal control strategy for a wide range of models of membrane filtration systems. The choice of the Julia programming language and its ecosystem is motivated by its high performance and ease of use for numerical integration, automatic differentiation, and optimization. The main features of the code will be presented, as well as the potential applications of this code in industry.'
