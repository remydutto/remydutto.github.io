I am currently a research engineer at the INRAE Occitanie-Montpellier, working on the WOc-WoD project with Jérôme Harmand and Alain Rapapport. The main objective is to develop optimal control laws for membrane filtration systems. 
My fields of interests are optimal control, artificial intelligence and optimization. The aim of my thesis was to propose new numerical optimal control methods supported by artificial intelligence to solve the torque split and gear shift problem on a hybrid electric vehicle.
